Minimum jerk planning.

For the robot inverse kinematics solution involved in this study, the angle value changes of the 6 joints were obtained. Minimum jerk planning obtained the third-order differentiable velocities and accelerations of the 6 joint angles.

Plot the curves of the angles, angular velocities, and angular acceleration values ​​of the 6 joints.
